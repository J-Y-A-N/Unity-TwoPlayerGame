# Unity-TwoPlayerGame

This is a two-player 3D Unity game. Two players can each control a ball using W, S, A, D or arrow keys, and the goal of this game is to make the other player's ball to fall off the playground. Everytime a ball falls off, the other player will earn a point. After the time runs out, the player with the higher score will win. 

To use this project, please import it to a new Unity 3D project and build under PC platform.
